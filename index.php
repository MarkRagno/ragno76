                <p>Having only very recently started in web development, I know my skills have a long way to go - and I am looking forward to that journey!</p>
                <p>I dove in head first by starting with a 9-5, 12-week, fully immersive bootcamp designed to do one thing:  turn me into a web developer.</p>
                <p>I will admit - it was one of the hardest things I've ever done.  But 1000% worth it.</p>
                <p>So much information was covered in such a short time span - my brain is still reeling.  Topics from PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git, MVC Frameworks, to you name it - we either dove in or at least talked about it.</p>
                <p>And while I am a novice, my confidence grows daily as I continue the disciplined learning on my own time.</p>
                <p>I am looking forward to my new career and can't wait to learn more!</p>
